Ch01 contains the preliminary stuff. It is made of the basics you need to learn to use numerical methods using C.
Plotting and making graphs is also an important part of computation. CH02 has programs written using C and plots made using gnuplot.
For series expansion and calculation, please take a look at ch03. For root finding, refer to ch04.
The Euler method and Runge-Kutta method for ODEs have been used in the programs included in ch05. In ch06, there are problems solved using the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule 
for integration. And ch07 has matrix methods and computation.

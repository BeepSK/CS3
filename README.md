Ch01 contains the preliminary stuff. It is composed of the fundamentals you need to learn to use numerical methods in C.
Plotting and making graphs is also an important part of computation. CH02 has programs written using C and plots made using gnuplot.
Ch03 includes programs required for series expansion, covering both finite and infinite series. You can use ch04 if you want to 
understand how to find roots for equations using C. Ch07 deals with matrices and their operations. It includes a file called 
Makemat.c that needs to be downloaded and used to assign and allocate matrices.
